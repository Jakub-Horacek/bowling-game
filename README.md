# Bowling Game

This is a small bowling game project developed back in May 2021. I found it in an old backup folder on my Google Drive and decided to revive it for nostalgia. The game involves collecting bowling pins with your bowling ball while avoiding obstacles (walls). It has a few bugs, but I've made this repository public for the fun of it.

## How to Play

### Controls:

- Use the **Left Arrow** to move the ball left.
- Use the **Right Arrow** to move the ball right.
- Press **Esc** to pause the game.

### Objective:

Collect as many bowling pins as you can while avoiding obstacles.
